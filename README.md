HTTPD AutoIndex CSS
===================

This repository contains custom CSS files that can be used with Apache HTTP 
Server as the Index StyleSheet for all server-generated directory listings.

The customized index CSS files were initially designed to be included with a 
customized Mikeotizels distribution of the Apache HTTP Server, but are now
available in own repository and can be optionally used with any compatible 
installation of the Apache HTTP Server software.
